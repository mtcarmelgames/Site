      But the people said nothing. <b>22</b> Then Elijah said to them, “I am the
      only one of the Lord’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty
      prophets. <b>23</b> Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one
      for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but
      not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood
      but not set fire to it. <b>24</b> Then you call on the name of your god,
      and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire—he is
      God.” Then all the people said, “What you say is good.” <b>25</b> Elijah
      said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one of the bulls and prepare it
      first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but
      do not light the fire.” <b>26</b> So they took the bull given them and
      prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon.
      “Baal, answer us!” they shouted. But there was no response; no one
      answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <b>27</b> At
      noon Elijah began to taunt them. “Shout louder!” he said. “Surely he is a
      god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is
      sleeping and must be awakened.” <b>28</b> So they shouted louder and
      slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until
      their blood flowed. <b>29</b> Midday passed, and they continued their
      frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there
      was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
